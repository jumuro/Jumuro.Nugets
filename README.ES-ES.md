# Jumuro.Nugets
Thinking in code modularization and reutilization, some specific functionalities used in the jumuro/OAuthServer repository have been extracted to NuGet packages and included in a Visual Studio solution that has been copied to this repository. Those NuGet packages could be reused in any .NET or AngularJS projects where needed.
